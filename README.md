# Dodie Coaching App's Development repository

This is the repository for the development of the new app Dodie Coaching

## The Idea

Dodie Coaching is born from the crossing of two distinct projects, but with the same goal.
Dodie is a talented woman who wants to help people by providing easy and accurate advices in the matter of nutrition, and Nev is a self-teached web developer who wants to build beautiful web apps that can provide really helpful services.
We decided to team-up to build this app that will, hopefully, grant you the will and the tools to live happily with your own body.

## The Project

Dodie Coaching will be developed within a predefined language framework (HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and SQL) for a school project at www.openclassrooms.com. Also ... no built-in frameworks are allowed.
The goal of the first project release will be to provide a showcase website and a way to choose a program, and then a way to contact Dodie to get a personal follow-up.

Later on, updates will be made to make this project not only a sales space, but above all a place for sharing and cheering each other up.

## Documentation

In this repository, you'll find a doc folder with all details about the choices we made, how and why we made them.
